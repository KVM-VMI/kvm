Build instructions
==================

Kernel
------

Enable the CONFIG_KVM_INTROSPECTION and CONFIG_REMOTE_MAPPING features
(besides the KVM ones) in the kernel config file.

	Virtualization
		Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) support
			VM Introspection

	Memory Management options
		Remote memory mapping

You should boot this kernel on a real system or under a hypervisor
supporting nested virtualization.

For convenience, "make kvmi_defconfig" can be used, which is based on
x86_64_defconfig.

QEMU
----

Regardless of how you will run the introspection tool, you need a custom
QEMU (the kvmi branch - https://github.com/KVM-VMI/qemu/tree/kvmi). If
you're planning to run the introspection tool in another VM, make sure
you build QEMU with vsock support.

Introspection tool
------------------

Just run 'make' in this directory. It will build a simple introspection
tool (kvmi-test) and a wrapper over the KVMI API (libkvmi.so).

Testing
=======

You will need a VM image that can be started by QEMU (the introspected VM).

Run the introspection tool on host
----------------------------------

Start the introspection tool:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./ ./kvmi-test /tmp/introspector

In another terminal, run the VM prepared for introspection with:

	qemu-system-x86_64 ... \
		-enable-kvm \
		-chardev socket,path=/tmp/introspector,id=chardev0,reconnect=10 \
		-object introspection,id=kvmi,chardev=chardev0

QEMU will connect to the introspection tool, pass the file descriptor to
the host kernel through /dev/kvm and boot the VM.

This simple introspection tool will pause the introspected VM, enable
a couple of introspection events (CR3, CR4, MSR_STAR) and resume the VM.

Run the introspection tool in another VM
----------------------------------------

In order to use the KVMI memory mapping for this particular VM (running
the introspection tool) you will have to enable KVM_INTROSPECTION_GUEST
in its kernel. But, in this case, for the host kernel, you have to
enable CONFIG_REMOTE_MAPPING.

When you start this VM use an additional QEMU argument:

	qemu-system-x86_64 ... \
		-device vhost-vsock-pci,id=vhost-vsock-pci0,guest-cid=3

Make sure the QEMU process has write access to /dev/vhost-vsock.

Copy kvmi-test and libkvmi.so to this new VM and run the kvmi-test program:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./ ./kvmi-test 1234

Make sure that kvmi-test has write access to /dev/vsock.

While the kvmi-test program is running, start the introspected VM from host with:

	qemu-system-x86_64 ... \
		-enable-kvm \
		-chardev socket,id=chardev0,cid=3,port=1234,reconnect=10 \
		-object introspection,id=kvmi,chardev=chardev0

Debug messages
==============

Enable CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG, CONFIG_FTRACE and CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER.

mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
echo "file kvmi_msg.c +p" >> /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo "file kvmi.c +p" >> /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

mount -t tracefs nodev /sys/kernel/tracing
echo 'kvmi:*' > /sys/kernel/tracing/set_event
cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe
